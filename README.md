haven't gotten to the graphics yet
in the console draws a map using printf

dry draft
scan and check_map should probably be put into one function and all checks should be completed

and each direction is a separate function (move_up, move_down) this is wasteful because there are repeated operations
from key_pressed  probably needed to go directly in map_anal
